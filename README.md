# Key Logger
- A Key Logger for windows

## Features
- The console window is hidden at startup.
- Identifies upper case and lower case letters.
- All recorded keystrokes would be stored in a file named YY-MM-MM_HH-MM-SS.log
 
## Build
- I use [Visual Studio Express 2015 for Windows Desktop](https://www.visualstudio.com/zh-tw/products/visual-studio-express-vs.aspx) to build this key logger.
